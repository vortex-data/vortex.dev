[TODO - Adam to fill in Datafusion 52 support]

The work mentioned in the previous bulletin to revamp Array evaluation to be fully lazy was released on January 6th. This happens by converting their execution to an Operator model that evaluates into Vectors (fully decompressed, zero-copy to Arrow representation). As a reminder, this work enables many more optimizations, and also provides unified abstractions for evaluating on
different processor types (CPUs & GPUs).

Speaking of, focus is now on GPU support. The goal is to enable querying training data on the fly and streaming it from object storage directly to GPU memory with high throughput. To achieve this, the team is: - adding the necessary encodings via Vortex's extensions to enable GPU-native decompression - integrating with NVIDIA's CUDA toolkit so GPUs can scan Vortex files in object storage directly

## Around the Ecosystem

- DuckDB Labs published performance benchmarks comparing Vortex (using the `duckdb-vortex` extension) versus Parquet. Spoiler alert: Vortex was ~18% faster!
- Spice AI began a blog series about building their data accelerato Cayenne with Vortex and Datafusion
