The work mentioned in the previous bulletin to revamp Array evaluation to be fully lazy was [released](https://github.com/vortex-data/vortex/releases/tag/0.57.0) on January 6th. This happens by converting their execution to an Operator model that evaluates into Vectors (fully decompressed, zero-copy to Arrow representation). As a reminder, this work enables many more optimizations, and also provides unified abstractions for evaluating on
different processor types (CPUs & GPUs).

## GPU Support

Speaking of, focus is now on support for reading Vortex files into GPUs. To achieve this, the team is

- Adding GPU decompression for existing kernels, as well as some new encodings optimized for GPU; and
- Integrating with NVIDIA's CUDA toolkit for high performance I/O.

The first supported output types will be Arrow Device Arrays and cuDF, and a few key PRs have already landed.

- Add CUDA kernels for decoding bitpacked arrays on GPU ([#6145](https://github.com/vortex-data/vortex/pull/6145))
- GPU filter kernel for primitive types ([#6188](https://github.com/vortex-data/vortex/pull/6188))
- GPU filter kernel for decimals, strings and binary ([#6196](https://github.com/vortex-data/vortex/pull/6196))
- GPU Scans ([#6199](https://github.com/vortex-data/vortex/pull/6199))

As with all of Vortex, these capabilities are fully exposed to plugins so advanced users can extend and customize for their own use.

## Around the Ecosystem

**DuckDB Labs** published [performance benchmarks](https://duckdb.org/2026/01/23/duckdb-vortex-extension) comparing Vortex (using the `vortex` extension) versus Parquet. Spoiler alert: Vortex reduced total query time by ~18-35%!

**Spice AI** began a blog series about building their data accelerato Cayenne with Vortex and Datafusion:

- [🔬 The Research Behind Modern Data Compression & Vortex](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lukekim_datafusion-developers-ai-activity-7417649503291498496-TD5_/)
- [🤖 Three Data Problems Vortex Solves for Applications and Agents in 2026](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lukekim_vortex-efficient-columnar-storage-for-hot-activity-7419472524750798848-lZC6/)

**DataFusion:** Over the past two months we've released support for DataFusion 51, and then merged support for DataFusion 52.

- Expression conversion is now extendable, allowing users to push down custom UDFs or any other DataFusion expressions.
- Support for schema evolution between files within the same table has improved dramatically, fixing many bugs and and allowing deeper pushdown over nested structs columns.
- We now support tables that have more complex arrow types (Like Dict, REE), while also doing less work exporting from Vortex to Arrow.
- Delegate some caching to to DataFusion's built in caching, allowing users to tune it using familiar configurations.

## Acknowledgments

We want to thank to anyone who has tried Vortex, provided feedback, asked question and filed issues.
