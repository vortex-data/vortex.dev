[TODO - Adam to fill in Datafusion 52 support]

The work mentioned in the previous bulletin to revamp Array evaluation to be fully lazy was released on January 6th. This happens by converting their execution to an Operator model that evaluates into Vectors (fully decompressed, zero-copy to Arrow representation). As a reminder, this work enables many more optimizations, and also provides unified abstractions for evaluating on
different processor types (CPUs & GPUs).

## GPU Support

Speaking of, focus is now on enabling reading Vortex files into GPUs. To achieve this, the team is:

- Adding GPU decompression for existing kernels, as well as some new encodings optimized for GPU
- Integrating with NVIDIA's CUDA toolkit for high performance I/O.

The first supported output types will be Arrow Device Arrays and cuDF. As with all of Vortex, these capabilities are fully exposed to plugins so advanced users can extend and customize for their own use.

## Around the Ecosystem

- DuckDB Labs published performance benchmarks comparing Vortex (using the `duckdb-vortex` extension) versus Parquet. Spoiler alert: Vortex was ~18% faster!
- Spice AI began a blog series about building their data accelerato Cayenne with Vortex and Datafusion
