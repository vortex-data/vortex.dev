In November, work continued on revamping Array evaluation to be fully lazy. This happens by converting their execution
to an Operator model that evaluates into Vectors (fully decompressed, zero-copy to Arrow representation). As a reminder, this work enables many more optimizations, and also provides unified abstractions for evaluating on
different processor types (CPUs & GPUs). We anticipate shipping lazy Array evaluation by the end of the year.

## Around the Ecosystem

- Spice AI launched the [Spice Cayenne Data Accelerator](https://spice.ai/blog/spice-cloud-v1-9-0-cayenne-data-accelerator) based on Vortex
- Polar Signals [replaced Parquet with Vortex](https://www.polarsignals.com/blog/posts/2025/11/25/interface-parquet-vortex) for their profiling database
  > Given how well Vortex’s design matched our needs, we tried it out and got a 70% average performance improvement on all our queries.
- Vortex is now a DuckDB [core extension](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/core_extensions/vortex) only and was removed from the list of community releases. To install:
  ```sql
  INSTALL vortex;
  ```
