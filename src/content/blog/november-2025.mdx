In November, work continued on revamping Array evaluation to be fully lazy, by converting their execution
to an Operator model that evaluates into Vectors (fully decompressed, zero-copy to Arrow representation).

As a reminder, this work enables many more optimizations, and also provides unified abstractions for evaluating on
different processor types (CPUs & GPUs). We anticipate shipping lazy Array evaluation

## Around the Ecosystem

- Polar Signals [replaced Parquet with Vortex](https://www.polarsignals.com/blog/posts/2025/11/25/interface-parquet-vortex) for their profiling database
  > Given how well Vortex’s design matched our needs, we tried it out and got a 70% average performance improvement on all our queries.
- Spice AI launched the [Spice Cayenne Data Accelerator](https://spice.ai/blog/spice-cloud-v1-9-0-cayenne-data-accelerator) based on Vortex

## Integrations

### DuckDB

Vortex is now a DuckDB [core extension](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/core_extensions/vortex) only and was removed from the list of community releases.

Starting with the next DuckDB version, `INSTALL vortex FROM community;` will no longer work. Instead, use `INSTALL vortex;`.

## Acknowledgments

We want to thank to anyone who has tried Vortex, provided feedback, asked question and filed issues.

Special congratulations to Alfonso Subiotto Marqués on joining the Technical Steering Committee as a committer.

The following contributed to the November releases.
