In October, a lot of focus was on revamping Array evaluation to be fully lazy, by converting their execution
to an Operator model that evaluates into Vectors (fully decompressed, zero-copy to Arrow representation).
This work enables many more optimizations, and also provides unified abstractions for evaluating on
different processor types (CPUs & GPUs).

In parallel, Vortex added experimental support for a GPU Scan, with fused CUDA kernels for decompressing Vortex data
directly on-device.

For an in-depth view of this work, see the [recent talk on Vortex](https://db.cs.cmu.edu/events/futuredata-vortex/)
as part of CMU's Future Data Seminar.

## Core

1. Children of `ZonedLayoutReader` are evaluated lazily. [#5007](https://github.com/vortex-data/vortex/pull/5007)
2. Introduced our own bit-buffer type, allowing for in-place mutation [#4940](https://github.com/vortex-data/vortex/pull/4940)
3. Introduced experimental GPU Scan [#5012](https://github.com/vortex-data/vortex/pull/5012)

## Integrations

### DFT

You can now try Vortex as part of [dft](https://github.com/datafusion-contrib/datafusion-dft), a batteries-included suite of data tools based on Apache DataFusion.

### DataFusion

1. Added support for pushing down filters onto fields of struct columns. #5024

### DuckDB

As of DuckDB 1.4.2, Vortex is included as a core extension in DuckDB. See their [docs](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/core_extensions/vortex) for more details.

## Acknowledgments

We want to thank to anyone who has tried Vortex, provided feedback, asked question and filed issues.

Special thanks go for all the contributors who took the time and care to contribute to Vortex this month (in descending count of commits):
