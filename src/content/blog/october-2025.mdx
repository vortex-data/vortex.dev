This month a lot of focus has been put on improving correctness using our fuzzer, in revamping arrays to make compute over compressed data and compute over GPUs even better.

## Core

1. Children of `ZonedLayoutReader` are evaluated lazily. [#5007]()
1. Introduced our own bit-buffer type, allowing for in-place mutation [#4940]()

## Integrations

### DFT

You can now try Vortex as part of [dft](https://github.com/datafusion-contrib/datafusion-dft), a batteries-included suite of data tools based on Apache DataFusion.

### DataFusion

1. Added support for pushing down filters onto fields of struct columns. #5024

## Acknowledgments

We want to thank to anyone who has tried Vortex, provided feedback, asked question and filed issues.

Special thanks go for all the contributors who took the time and care to contribute to Vortex this month (in descending count of commits):
