> Editor's note: Its been pointed out to us that while this post is published in October, it covers work done in September, so this will be the second September Bulletin.

This is the second monthly issue of all that has been happening in Vortex!

Development keeps moving quickly, with many new features and improvements to the Rust API. This month we accepted 180 commits from 13 different contributors, with the relentless renovate-bot taking the crown for most changes merged.

## Core

1. Published an [RFC](https://github.com/vortex-data/vortex/pull/4726) presenting our planned changes to how arrays and compute interact with each other, introducing what we call Operators.
1. Started work on GPU-powered kernels.
1. Merged a few big changes to the IO APIs ([#4557](https://github.com/vortex-data/vortex/pull/4608), [#4608](https://github.com/vortex-data/vortex/pull/4608)), which introduce new push-based write API (in addition to the existing stream-based one), and writes now return both the file's footer (which can now be cached, reused and even de/serialized [#4598](https://github.com/vortex-data/vortex/pull/4608)), and the file's total compressed size.
1. Added a new encoding - [fastlanes](https://github.com/spiraldb/fastlanes)-based RLE [#4588](https://github.com/vortex-data/vortex/pull/4588), [#4789](https://github.com/vortex-data/vortex/pull/4789).
1. The work on the new `FixedSizeList` keeps moving forward - [#4590](https://github.com/vortex-data/vortex/pull/4590), [#4601](https://github.com/vortex-data/vortex/pull/4601).
1. Added a new canonical encoding for list types, see the [tracking issue](https://github.com/vortex-data/vortex/issues/4699) for full details and work.
1. Fixed a long-standing issue where we used to underestimate the uncompressed size of arrays, causing inaccurate array stats and a consistent underestimation of the overall data size. [#4963](https://github.com/vortex-data/vortex/pull/4693).
1. Improved performance for very wide tables (1K+ columns), improving a new compression [benchmark](https://github.com/vortex-data/vortex/pull/4867) by over 80%. [#4863](https://github.com/vortex-data/vortex/pull/4863) [#4868](https://github.com/vortex-data/vortex/pull/4868) [#4877](https://github.com/vortex-data/vortex/pull/4877)
1. Allow users to write with different compression strategies from Python [#4825](https://github.com/vortex-data/vortex/pull/4825)

## Integrations

### DuckDB

1. Landed a release of the Vortex extension for the most recent DuckDB release (1.4). As always, you can install and load the extension with:

   ```sql
   INSTALL vortex FROM community;
   LOAD vortex;
   ```

1. Improved the testing of our DuckDB extension, making it easier and faster to run tests, using a debug build of DuckDB.
1. Added zero-copy exporting of arrays to DuckDB [#4812](https://github.com/vortex-data/vortex/pull/4812) [#4804](https://github.com/vortex-data/vortex/pull/4804)

### Apache DataFusion

1. Use the built-in `FilePruner` to prune file based on the full expression, even for expressions we can't push down yet like dynamic expressions.
1. Support for tables with hive-style partitioning.
1. Updated our Apache DataFusion integration to the most recent release (v50.1.0) [#4577](https://github.com/vortex-data/vortex/pull/4577)
